🚀 Project Completed: Visualization and Analysis of Health Activity 📊💻
I'm excited to share that I've completed a data analysis and visualization project using Python, based on the Health Activity Dataset! This project helped me dive deeper into the world of data science, focusing on real-world health insights through visual storytelling.
🔍 Key Objectives Analyzed:
📈 Relationship Between Age and BMI
🚶‍♂️ Daily Steps in Relation to Heart Disease Status
💤 Impact of Sleep Duration on Heart Rate
🚬 Influence of Smoking Habits on Heart Disease Prevalence
❤️ The Overall Prevalence of Heart Disease in the dataset
🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Data Cleaning, EDA, and Visualization techniques
This project not only strengthened my Python skills but also helped me understand how data can be used to uncover meaningful health trends that could impact lives.
📌 Looking forward to feedback, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities!
